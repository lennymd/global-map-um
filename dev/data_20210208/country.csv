"Games for a Caribbean Climate","Professor Lien Tran received a grant from Invoking the Pause to introduce the use of games with local and regional climate and disaster risk management organizations in Barbados. In June 2014, Professor Tran organized and co-facilitated a 2-day workshop called ""Let's Adapt: Games for Climate Change Resiliency"" along with team members Reynette Royer from the IFRC's Red Cross Caribbean Disaster Risk Management Reference Center (CADRIM), Mini Saraswati from the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre (RCCC), and Professor Clay Ewing (also from UM's School of Communication). As a result of this unique funding opportunity, these organizations were able to partner together for the first time and to introduce an innovative approach to reaching climate risk stakeholders in the Caribbean.

Workshop participants represented the Barbados Red Cross, Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Caribbean Institute for Meteorology & Hydrology (CIMH), Community Disaster Response Teams (CDRT), and the University of the West Indies’ Centre for Resource Management and Environmental Studies (CERMES). By connecting relevant parties from Barbados and around the region on new participatory approaches to adaptation, this workshop explored how interactive resources and game-based activities can assist in the task of communicating climate change information and invoking grassroots participation within Caribbean communities. As a direct result of this workshop, Professor Tran is now discussing future plans to formally adapt and disseminate some of the games presented at the workshop - like Humans vs. Mosquitoes - as well as new climate-related topics with communities in the Caribbean.","Barbados","Research"
"Humans vs. Mosquitoes","Humans vs. Mosquitoes is a simple non-digital game for social impact that educates players about the relationship between humans, mosquitoes, vector-borne diseases and the environment. Originally designed in 2011, the game has been used by facilitators in at least 4 continents as a fun and engaging way to teach audiences about vector-borne diseases. The game has been modified and adapted to work in various geographic regions as well as with different audiences. Humans vs. Mosquitoes can be played as an active physical play-based game, a thoughtful card game, and even with nothing but a set of instructions and a set of gestures.","Barbados","Research"

As one of 13 American broadcast journalists selected for a two-week fully funded fellowship, it was a transformative experience  to interact with German leaders in politics and media and to learn about our similarities and our differences. The conversations provided an extensive amount of fodder for news stories, as well as, increased transatlantic understanding.","Belgium","Research"

"Globalness and Localness for Brands in the Transitioning Chinese Market","Focusing on the transitioning Chinese market, this study examined the interplay between perceived brand globalness and localness for local and global brands. Focus groups and in-depth interviews were first conducted to explore Chinese consumers’ changing meaning-making of iconic global and Chinese brands. The qualitative findings illuminated consumers’ evolving understanding of global and local brands, and the complicated dynamics between perceived brand globalness and localness. An online survey was subsequently administered to empirically assess the connection between brand globalness and localness across different iconic local and global brand pairs. The impacts of these brand perceptions on brand prestige and quality were further evaluated.","China","Research"

Abstract
Online privacy seeks to protect the identity of individuals who use the internet to collect information or express opinions. However, given the proliferating vehicles through which one's identity can be ascertained, the question remains as to what policies can most effectively protect personal identity. This paper explores the similarities and differences with online privacy regulation in the United States and China. The scope of privacy measures examined here ranges from government to personal levels, from communication and finance to personal records, for adults and children. As might be expected in a democracy, American legislative initiatives are more comprehensive and far-reaching than those of their Chinese counterparts. In China, there was until recently no specific right of privacy specified in dedicated legislation, with privacy having been instead protected under the right of reputation in the Civil law. Policy implications stemming from these competing models are evaluated. Study findings underscore the notion that privacy should be a universally established individual right, and that both countries are moving—at least in rhetorical terms—to strengthen it as such..","China","Research"

The present study investigates the influence of micro-blogs on the major agenda-setting media in China in the immediate aftermath of a catastrophic railway accident. Study findings are based on a content analysis of micro-blog messages and traditional mainstream media reports that were published in the nine days subsequent to the July 23, 2011 bullet train crash accident. Results suggest that, in the immediate aftermath of a catastrophic train wreck, alternative online media played a decisive role in setting mainstream media agendas and providing a citizen forum on a sensitive issue that their conventional counterparts downplayed, ignored, or missed altogether. In particular, the traditional media’s agenda setting power is no longer universal nor singular within micro-blogging outlets. Instead, traditional media—once a monolithic establishment—are now just one of the role players among many competing influences.","China","Research"

"Professional Autonomy in Journalism","Professional autonomy has usually been defined in terms of journalists’ perceptions of their control over their work vis-à-vis organizational supervisors. Using surveys of journalists in Colombia and Mexico, we identify two dimensions of perceived autonomy: first, control over story development tasks (the traditional understanding of autonomy in empirical studies); second, the ability to actually publish news on a range of subjects associated with different levels of material or cultural power. We then identify the predictors of both dimensions of autonomy. Physical threats, overlapping forms of inequality, and clientelism characterize pressures on autonomy in these two democracies. Journalists can carve out more space for autonomy by gaining professional experience or by creating new organizational arrangements and supporting analytical, change-oriented norms. By examining professional autonomy empirically in a broad range of contexts, we demonstrate that autonomy is more complex, situational, and historically contingent than previously believed. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1464884916659409?journalCode=joua","Colombia","Research"

"Journalism in Insecure Democracies","Collaboration with colleagues in Mexico, El Salvador, Colombia and South Africa to research and write the research article, ""Expanding Influences Research to Insecure Democracies: How Violence, Public Insecurity, Economic Inequality, and Uneven Democratic Performance Shape Journalists’ Perceived Work"".

Abstract
Democracies with sharp violence and public insecurity have proliferated in recent decades, with many also featuring extreme economic inequality. These conditions have not been explicitly considered in comparative research on journalists’ work environments, an omission that may obscure important realities of contemporary journalism. We address this gap through an analysis of journalist surveys in 62 countries. We confirm the existence of insecure democracies as an empirical phenomenon and begin to unravel their meaning for journalists. We find democracies with uneven democratic performance tend to have more journalist assassinations, which is the most extreme form of influence on work, and that levels of democratic performance, violence, public insecurity, and economic inequality significantly shape how journalists perceive various influences in their work environment. Case studies of insecure democracies in Africa and Latin America address why these conditions sometimes (but not always) lead to journalist assassinations and other anti-press violence. They suggest anti-press violence is higher when sub-national state actors intensify criminal violence and when insecurity is geographically and topically proximate to journalists. How journalists perceive influences on work are therefore more complex and multidimensional than previous research has suggested. The study concludes by identifying areas for improvement in data collection.

"Journalism in Insecure Democracies","Collaboration with colleagues in Mexico, El Salvador, Colombia and South Africa to research and write the research article, ""Expanding Influences Research to Insecure Democracies: How Violence, Public Insecurity, Economic Inequality, and Uneven Democratic Performance Shape Journalists’ Perceived Work"".

Abstract
Democracies with sharp violence and public insecurity have proliferated in recent decades, with many also featuring extreme economic inequality. These conditions have not been explicitly considered in comparative research on journalists’ work environments, an omission that may obscure important realities of contemporary journalism. We address this gap through an analysis of journalist surveys in 62 countries. We confirm the existence of insecure democracies as an empirical phenomenon and begin to unravel their meaning for journalists. We find democracies with uneven democratic performance tend to have more journalist assassinations, which is the most extreme form of influence on work, and that levels of democratic performance, violence, public insecurity, and economic inequality significantly shape how journalists perceive various influences in their work environment. Case studies of insecure democracies in Africa and Latin America address why these conditions sometimes (but not always) lead to journalist assassinations and other anti-press violence. They suggest anti-press violence is higher when sub-national state actors intensify criminal violence and when insecurity is geographically and topically proximate to journalists. How journalists perceive influences on work are therefore more complex and multidimensional than previous research has suggested. The study concludes by identifying areas for improvement in data collection.

Premiered at the Tube Factory artspace exhibition Christos Koutsouras ""Land Art (telling trees)"" This short documentary features three Greek artists who work on the island of Samos. Koutsouras is one of the three. Dia Kontaxis is a professor at the University of Miami. Her work has screened at museums, galleries and festivals including Venice (Art Biennale), New York (Tribeca Film Festival), Montreal (Art Fifa), Paris, Athens, Ankara, Lleida, Taipei and Miami (Art Basel).

Telling Trees:
 https://vimeo.com/291196859

""A full commission, Land Art (Telling Trees) includes large photographs manipulated by Koutsouras in different ways. Some pieces are painted on, others drawn upon with pencil, and some left intact. The work captures the destruction and rebirth of the forests and fields of Samos from fires that swept through the landscape. He created other works by wrapping paper around the burned trees of Samos and rubbing charcoal imprints. The exhibition also ties Samos and Indianapolis (two places Koutsouras has lived at different times throughout his life) together with a sculpture made from two pine trees from the west side of Indianapolis blown over by straight winds. The 40-year-old trees were saved from rot or becoming mulched by Indy Urban Hardwood.

The upstairs video room featured a documentary about Koutsouras and two other Greek artists by filmmaker Dia Kontaxis, a professor at the University of Miami. Her work has screened at museums, galleries and festivals including Venice (Art Biennale), New York (Tribeca Film Festival), Montreal (Art Fifa), Paris, Athens, Ankara, Lleida, Taipei and Miami (Art Basel). In the video piece at the top, also by Kontaxis, Koutsouras paints the charred trees white to contrast with the blackness of the landscape.

Koutsouras, who studied painting in Germany, often pulls from the instruction of an inspirational teacher and tries to make each work into its own narrative. Each piece must have a beginning, middle and end. The result in this show: a story of the destructive and restorative forces of nature.""","Greece","Research"

"Community Based Participatory Research to Raise HIV Awareness Among Young Adults","HIV/AIDS is one of the top ten causes of death among Guatemalans (CDC, 2010). While AIDS-related deaths declined significantly in many Latin American countries during the period 2005 äóñ 2013, Guatemala exhibited a 95% increase in such deaths (2013 estimates; UNAIDS, 2014). Mayans are particularly susceptible to HIV transmission as a consequence of their relative poverty, limited health care access and preference for local languages over Spanish (Kadetz, 2014), which hinder Mayan awareness of HIV and treatment options. Despite the documented vulnerabilities, HIV knowledge assessments and prevention campaigns have not widely accessed the Guatemalan Mayan communities. This paper discusses the formative research that investigates the applicability of the Health Belief Model to identify the barriers and facilitators to HIV testing and condom use in rural Guatemala. The current paper describes the formative research collected to develop a culturally appropriate campaign plan.","Guatemala","Research"

"Engaging the Capacity of Local Comadronas in Rural Guatemala","Guatemala has the 3rd highest rate of maternal mortality in Latin America, and indigenous Mayan women account for 71% of deaths. The majority of maternal deaths are from preventable causes, including HIV/AIDS. The USAID cites HIV as a major cause of maternal mortality and emphasizes addressing both systemic and individual barriers to comprehensive care for HIV-infected pregnant women. One such barrier is access to government health care facilities, which can accommodate only a limited number of births. Comadronas (Mayan birth attendants) have bridged this gap by providing prenatal and homebirth assistance to indigenous women, but the potential impact of the comadrona as a vehicle for a more holistic approach to sexual and reproductive health promotion has not been explored. This application is aimed to establish a foundation for expanding the role of the comadronas to include HIV prevention, thereby providing a strategy to enhance reproductive wellbeing. To accomplish this aim, we propose to 

1) to culturally adapt SEPA content for this Mayan community and 
2) to examine the feasibility and acceptability of integration of SEPA into current comadrona training.  

SEPA is an existing, evidence-based HIV prevention intervention targeting heterosexual women, which has been successfully implemented and culturally adapted to the Chilean context. The PI will work with community partners to determine factors that must be included in adapting SEPA for indigenous women. Focus groups of comadronas will determine their opinions about the intervention quality and relevance of SEPA and identify HIV testing facilitators and barriers among comadronas that influence the extent to which they could conduct HIV testing. Fifty in-depth interviews with indigenous men and women will also provide necessary socio-cultural information on gender inequality, partner communication, and condom use and HIV testing promotion that will be integrated into a tailored version of SEPA.","Guatemala","Research"
"A Community-Based Approach to HIV Prevention","Abstract: Background. Guatemala has an accelerating HIV rate, where prevalence is three
times higher among indigenous than nonindigenous people. Vulnerability is exacerbated by
high poverty, low literacy, and poor access to prevention messaging, testing, and treatment
options. This study develops a community- engaged HIV prevention campaign plan for the
underserved Mayan town Santiago Atitlán. Guided by the community- based participatory
research approach and the Health Belief Model, we identify barriers to and facilitators of
HIV testing and condom use. Methods. Formative data were collected from 50 Mayan
heterosexual adults (18– 25 years old) and community informants using in-depth interviews
and a focus group. Results. Data identified high susceptibility and severity, low rates of
condom use, high rates of stigma and low testing rates. Discussion. This research informs
the development of a theoretically driven and culturally specific intervention that prioritizes
an indigenous population. We highlight how collaboration with community partners enhances positive health promotion.","Guatemala","Research"
"Engaging the Capacity of Comadronas as HIV Prevention Sources in Rural Guatemala","In this study the author address rural Guatemala’s poor maternal health and HIV status by integrating an effective evidence-based HIV intervention (SEPA), with local implementing health partners to extend the capacity of comadronas (traditional Mayan birth attendants) to encompass HIV prevention. I employed a multi-method design consisting of a focus group, an interview, and participant observation to identify important factors surrounding comadrona receptivity towards expanding their capacity to HIV prevention. I analyzed data using thematic analysis and identified four categories: Project logistics, HIV knowledge, and risk assessment, condom perceptions, and HIV testing perceptions. I affirm comadrona receptivity toward HIV prevention, and that will guide future cultural adaptation and tailoring of SEPA for comadrona training. I will use my results to create a prototype intervention that could be applied to other similarly underserved indigenous communities.","Guatemala","Research"
"A Community-Based Approach to HIV Prevention in Rural Guatemala","Background. HIV is one of the primary causes of death in Guatemala, and during the period 2005 to 2013, Guatemala exhibited a 95% increase in such deaths. HIV transmission rates are nearly 3 times higher among the indigenous Mayan population than nonindigenous Guatemalans. Guided by the community-based participatory research approach, this article demonstrates the iterative formative research process necessary to develop a deeper and more informed understanding of HIV prevention attitudes and behaviors in the priority population. This project extends preliminary formative research that demonstrated the applicability of the health belief model (HBM) in examining risk, stigma, and barriers and facilitators to condom use and HIV testing. Method. Using an integrated mixed-method design, data were collected from heterosexual adults 18- to 25 years old (N = 250), including 50 in-depth interviews and 200 rapid assessment surveys. Results. HBM concepts of risk and stigma were confirmed. Data also revealed low rates of condom negotiation and high embarrassment in purchasing and discussing condom use. Furthermore, data yielded very low uptake rates and reduced levels of comfort with getting tested. Conclusion. This research informs the refinement of a culture-specific intervention prioritizing indigenous Mayans. We highlight how community-based research and engagement enhance community health promotion.","Guatemala","Research"

"Games for a Caribbean Climate","Professor Lien Tran received a grant from Invoking the Pause to introduce the use of games with local and regional climate and disaster risk management organizations in Barbados. In June 2014, Professor Tran organized and co-facilitated a 2-day workshop called ""Let's Adapt: Games for Climate Change Resiliency"" along with team members Reynette Royer from the IFRC's Red Cross Caribbean Disaster Risk Management Reference Center (CADRIM), Mini Saraswati from the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre (RCCC), and Professor Clay Ewing (also from UM's School of Communication). As a result of this unique funding opportunity, these organizations were able to partner together for the first time and to introduce an innovative approach to reaching climate risk stakeholders in the Caribbean.

Workshop participants represented the Barbados Red Cross, Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Caribbean Institute for Meteorology & Hydrology (CIMH), Community Disaster Response Teams (CDRT), and the University of the West Indies’ Centre for Resource Management and Environmental Studies (CERMES). By connecting relevant parties from Barbados and around the region on new participatory approaches to adaptation, this workshop explored how interactive resources and game-based activities can assist in the task of communicating climate change information and invoking grassroots participation within Caribbean communities. As a direct result of this workshop, Professor Tran is now discussing future plans to formally adapt and disseminate some of the games presented at the workshop - like Humans vs. Mosquitoes - as well as new climate-related topics with communities in the Caribbean.","Jamaica","Research"

"Professional Autonomy in Journalism","Professional autonomy has usually been defined in terms of journalists’ perceptions of their control over their work vis-à-vis organizational supervisors. Using surveys of journalists in Colombia and Mexico, we identify two dimensions of perceived autonomy: first, control over story development tasks (the traditional understanding of autonomy in empirical studies); second, the ability to actually publish news on a range of subjects associated with different levels of material or cultural power. We then identify the predictors of both dimensions of autonomy. Physical threats, overlapping forms of inequality, and clientelism characterize pressures on autonomy in these two democracies. Journalists can carve out more space for autonomy by gaining professional experience or by creating new organizational arrangements and supporting analytical, change-oriented norms. By examining professional autonomy empirically in a broad range of contexts, we demonstrate that autonomy is more complex, situational, and historically contingent than previously believed. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1464884916659409?journalCode=joua","Mexico","Research"

"Journalism in Insecure Democracies","Collaboration with colleagues in Mexico, El Salvador, Colombia and South Africa to research and write the research article, ""Expanding Influences Research to Insecure Democracies: How Violence, Public Insecurity, Economic Inequality, and Uneven Democratic Performance Shape Journalists’ Perceived Work"".

Abstract
Democracies with sharp violence and public insecurity have proliferated in recent decades, with many also featuring extreme economic inequality. These conditions have not been explicitly considered in comparative research on journalists’ work environments, an omission that may obscure important realities of contemporary journalism. We address this gap through an analysis of journalist surveys in 62 countries. We confirm the existence of insecure democracies as an empirical phenomenon and begin to unravel their meaning for journalists. We find democracies with uneven democratic performance tend to have more journalist assassinations, which is the most extreme form of influence on work, and that levels of democratic performance, violence, public insecurity, and economic inequality significantly shape how journalists perceive various influences in their work environment. Case studies of insecure democracies in Africa and Latin America address why these conditions sometimes (but not always) lead to journalist assassinations and other anti-press violence. They suggest anti-press violence is higher when sub-national state actors intensify criminal violence and when insecurity is geographically and topically proximate to journalists. How journalists perceive influences on work are therefore more complex and multidimensional than previous research has suggested. The study concludes by identifying areas for improvement in data collection.

"Psychological Support for Journalists Experiencing Occupational Stress","Journalism has become a high-risk, high-stress occupation in many countries around the world, but especially in societies where public insecurity, violence and impunity prevail. Mexico is both emblematic and extreme in this regard, with 95 journalist assassinations, 20 disappearances, and 3594 other aggressions against journalists documented since 2006, according to the Mexico City office of the international press rights organization Article 19. Besides physical and verbal attacks, journalists in Mexico and elsewhere are often subjected to difficult labor conditions such as poor pay, lack of benefits, long hours and fast pace of work that provoke high levels of occupational stress. In the last year, Mexican female journalists have been denouncing sexual harassment and assault, like female journalists around the world, under the Twitter hashtag #metooperiodistas. Consequently, the negative effects on mental health and quality of life for journalists and for their families can be devastating. Nevertheless, the attention to their mental health, broadly conceptualized, has been extremely limited and sporadic at best.

This first phase of the study consisted of online interviews with journalists in Mexico and Brazil to identify their perceptions about the levels and sources of occupational stress they experience, coping strategies they engage in, whether they believe these strategies are successful and their ideas for how they could be better supported.

Based upon findings from phase one, our objective for phase two of the  project is to design, test and implement an “app” or “serious game” that will provide “psychological first aid” to journalists experiencing acute symptoms of stress. We rely upon the psychological expertise of Dr. Hilda Fernández de Ortega Bárcenas, who is head of graduate studies in the Department of Psychology at UDLAP;  Hughes'  experience as a social science researcher of Journalism, Journalist Safety, Politics and Media in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America; and the expertise of UM Associate Professor Clay Ewing, who is a designer of “serious games” with social impact.  

The intervention will be designed to address the immediate symptoms of occupational stress journalists experience in order to ameliorate the negative impact of stressful situations or events and to promote the development of adaptive coping strategies to improve their mental health and ultimately the well-being. The participation of journalist associations and human rights organizations will be essential to the success of the project since they are in close contact with journalists in distress and have earned the trust of these journalists.

This first phase of the study is being extended to Venezuela, Colombia and possibly the US. We intend to extend the app or game to these contexts after the pilot is finished in Mexico.","Mexico","Research"
"Colloquium on Anniversary of Book, ""Newsrooms in Conflict""","This was a colloquium on the continuing relevance of the book, Newsrooms in Conflict: Journalism and the Democratization of Mexico, written by Dr. Sallie Hughes. 

The book's description is here and below: https://upittpress.org/books/9780822959281/

""Newsrooms in Conflict examines the dramatic changes within Mexican society, politics, and journalism that transformed an authoritarian media institution into many conflicting styles of journalism with very different implications for deepening democracy in the country. Using extensive interviews with journalists and content analysis spanning more than two decades, Sallie Hughes identifies the patterns of newsroom transformation that explain how Mexican journalism was changed from a passive and even collusive institution into conflicting clusters of news organizations exhibiting citizen-oriented, market-driven, and adaptive authoritarian tendencies. Hughes explores the factors that brought about this transformation, including not only the democratic upheaval within Mexico and the role of the market, but also the diffusion of ideas, the transformation of professional identities and, most significantly, the profound changes made within the newsrooms themselves. From the Zapatista rebellion to the political bribery scandals that rocked the nation, Hughes's investigation presents a groundbreaking model of the sociopolitical transformation of a media institution within a new democracy, and the rise and subsequent stagnation of citizen-focused journalism after that democracy were established.""","Mexico","Research"
"National Mexican Journalism Studies Research Network","Researchers from 11 Mexican and US academic institutions have formed the National Journalism Studies Research Network to carry out the Worlds of Journalism III – Mexico. The research network will generate data to better understand and explain the reality of journalism in Mexico and compare Mexican journalists on a global scale through a rigorous methodology of nationally based surveys. In its previous phase (2012-2015), the groundbreaking international project produced information about journalists and journalism through more than 22,000 interviews of working journalists in 66 countries, including Mexico.

The principle objective of the study is to help researchers, journalists, members of civil society and political actors to better understand journalists’ worldviews and professional orientations, the conditions and limitations under which they operate, and the social functions of journalism in a changing world. In the third phase of the study topics such as the security and resiliency of journalists worldwide will be a priority.

    The researchers who make up the network agree to apply the survey questionnaire in all regions of the country, as well as verify and systematize data collected nationally during this process.

            The work began on March 28 and 29 at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics (CIDE), in Mexico City, where the participants formed operational committees and made agreements about the study methodology and sampling.

The University of Miami Institute for Advanced Study of the Americas (UMIA), with the CIDE and Iberoamerican University-Mexico City, organized and sponsored the workshop where the network was formed.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26122576
Abstract
Guánica Bay, located in southwestern Puerto Rico, has suffered oil spills and other pollution discharges since the 1960s. Previous research showed elevated concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in coral reef and sediment. This research examined PCB concentrations in sediment and fish. Sediment and fish sampling in the bay was facilitated by community members. This study identified the second highest reported PCB level (129,300 ng/g) in sediment in the USA. Fish samples also showed elevated concentrations (1623 to 3768 ng/g), which were higher than the thresholds of safe levels of PCBs in fish for human consumption. The alarmingly high concentration of PCBs calls for proactive community engagement to bring awareness about contamination of the bay and more extensive sampling to test for the concentration of PCBs in seafood and the people of Guánica. This study also underscores the value of the involvement of local communities during sampling design aimed at identifying hot spots of contaminants.

"Journalism in Insecure Democracies","Collaboration with colleagues in Mexico, El Salvador, Colombia and South Africa to research and write the research article, ""Expanding Influences Research to Insecure Democracies: How Violence, Public Insecurity, Economic Inequality, and Uneven Democratic Performance Shape Journalists’ Perceived Work"".

Abstract
Democracies with sharp violence and public insecurity have proliferated in recent decades, with many also featuring extreme economic inequality. These conditions have not been explicitly considered in comparative research on journalists’ work environments, an omission that may obscure important realities of contemporary journalism. We address this gap through an analysis of journalist surveys in 62 countries. We confirm the existence of insecure democracies as an empirical phenomenon and begin to unravel their meaning for journalists. We find democracies with uneven democratic performance tend to have more journalist assassinations, which is the most extreme form of influence on work, and that levels of democratic performance, violence, public insecurity, and economic inequality significantly shape how journalists perceive various influences in their work environment. Case studies of insecure democracies in Africa and Latin America address why these conditions sometimes (but not always) lead to journalist assassinations and other anti-press violence. They suggest anti-press violence is higher when sub-national state actors intensify criminal violence and when insecurity is geographically and topically proximate to journalists. How journalists perceive influences on work are therefore more complex and multidimensional than previous research has suggested. The study concludes by identifying areas for improvement in data collection.

"Games for a Caribbean Climate","Professor Lien Tran received a grant from Invoking the Pause to introduce the use of games with local and regional climate and disaster risk management organizations in Barbados. In June 2014, Professor Tran organized and co-facilitated a 2-day workshop called ""Let's Adapt: Games for Climate Change Resiliency"" along with team members Reynette Royer from the IFRC's Red Cross Caribbean Disaster Risk Management Reference Center (CADRIM), Mini Saraswati from the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre (RCCC), and Professor Clay Ewing (also from UM's School of Communication). As a result of this unique funding opportunity, these organizations were able to partner together for the first time and to introduce an innovative approach to reaching climate risk stakeholders in the Caribbean.

Workshop participants represented the Barbados Red Cross, Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Caribbean Institute for Meteorology & Hydrology (CIMH), Community Disaster Response Teams (CDRT), and the University of the West Indies’ Centre for Resource Management and Environmental Studies (CERMES). By connecting relevant parties from Barbados and around the region on new participatory approaches to adaptation, this workshop explored how interactive resources and game-based activities can assist in the task of communicating climate change information and invoking grassroots participation within Caribbean communities. As a direct result of this workshop, Professor Tran is now discussing future plans to formally adapt and disseminate some of the games presented at the workshop - like Humans vs. Mosquitoes - as well as new climate-related topics with communities in the Caribbean.","Trinidad & Tobago","Research"

Newer arrivals come with fewer resources than early waves of Cuban immigrants and currently arrive with initially undocumented immigration status (and many are being deported under the Trump administration). These immigrants are/were often ignored or stigmatized in mainstream media outlets, although there is a bit more sensitivity only two years after this course. The course taught students about the history of the Cuban community in Miami as well as the current realities of the community.

"Roadmap to Opportunity-Immigrant Guide to Education and Professional Development","Our interdisciplinary team is currently researching and prototyping Roadmap to Opportunity, an evidence-based decision support tool, specifically for late-arriving refugees and immigrant adolescents to understand the education and professional development options available to them.

The initial scope of this roadmap focuses on paths available to students in GED programs, resources and opportunities specific to Miami-Dade County, and where possible we can make clear what information is generalizable at the state level and nationally. We have interviewed individuals who have gone through a GED program and will continue to interview them and consult with subject matter experts on the personas and scenarios we developed based on these interviews. After we have a proof of concept specific to the GED setting and Miami-Dade County, we hope to scale the decision support tool to be implemented in different settings (e.g. refugee resettlement programs, shelters for unaccompanied immigrant minors) and cover south Florida and beyond. This tool even has the possibility to scale to a more general population including first-generation college students.

This decision support tool will likely be available online and in English and Spanish initially.

This is a transnational project relevant to immigrant and refugee communities, focused initially on but not limited to those coming to Miami / the U.S. from Latin America, Caribbean, and South America. However, aspects of the project will be relevant to all immigrant and refugee communities and eventually could be expanded to be relevant to all those seeking higher education and professional development opportunities.

This is a partnership between UM School of Communication and UM School of Education and Human Development with support from the University of Miami Institute of Advanced Study of the Americas.","United States","Research"

"Increasing EIMC uptake in Zambia: Like Father, Like Son","Early Infant Medical Circumcision (EIMC, performed during the first 60 days of life). EIMC is a safer, simpler and less expensive procedure than adult VMMC with shorter healing times (Weiss et al., 2010; Binagwaho 2010; WHO/UNAIDS 2007). In addition to offering lifetime protection from several diseases, EIMC has been associated with improved penile hygiene and fewer urinary tract infections which are prevalent in uncircumcised infants. By increasing the availability and acceptability of both EIMC and VMMC, the overall population health benefit of male circumcision could be realized in less than one generation. Consequently, as VMMC promotion began, the GRZ Ministry of Health (MOH) began development of an Early Infant Medical Circumcision (EIMC) program as a longterm HIV prevention solution for the ~360,000 male neonates born yearly in Zambia (GRZ Central Statistics Office, 2018). However, among 2000 Zambian pregnant women provided with information on EIMC, 97% agreed they would circumcise their infant if  they had a boy, but only 11% actually did so (Waters et al., 2013). More recently, the 2016-2020 GRZ VMMC operating plan (Republic of Zambia Ministry of Health, 2016) reported significantly lower uptake of infant MC had been achieved by 2015 than originally targeted. In fact, as of October 1, only 1,181 of the 362,078 newborn males in 2018 underwent EIMC (GRZ Central Statistics Office, 2018; clinic data); in EIMC trained clinics in Lusaka, only ~0.02% of male infants were circumcised in 2018 (clinic data).

The proposed study seeks to address this discordance by developing and testing an innovative “father and son” biobehavioral demand generation strategy, providing on-site availability of EIMC and VMMC services embedded in the Spear & Shield behavioral intervention. The program, entitled “Like Father, Like Son” (LFLS), will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of promoting and offering combined EIMC and VMMC services and behavioral interventions, building on successful implementation strategies utilized in S&S.","Zambia","Research"
